Chapter 1 - Data, Databases, and the Software Engineering Process
======================================================================
1.2 - Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------

data - facts about something or someone 

database - collection of related data 
	* related - a common characteristic that ties the data together 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 - What is the Software Engineering Process?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
software engineering - process of specifying, designing, writing, 
delivering, maintaining, and retiring software 

"players" in software development life cycle:
	1. user - uses software
	2. analyst - design software

Software (Database) Development Process (Waterfall model): 
	1. Requirement - find out what user wants/needs (eludicdation)
	2. Specification - write what user wants/needs PRECISELY
		* document costs and time 
		2a. Feed back the specification to the user - formal review
		2b. Redo the specification as needed and return to 2a 
	3. Design - software is designed to meet the specification 
		* draw up blueprints 
		3a. Design is checked against specification
	4. Development - software is written; database is created 
		4a. During development, check software against design 
			* database is created and populated 
	5. Implementation - software turned over for user to be used 
		in application 
		5a. User tests software - accept or reject 
	6. Maintenance - some parts may fail, requirements change, etc. 
		* time-consuming and expensive 
	7. Retirement - eventually software becomes outdated

When software (databases) are retired, the SE process begins anew.

1.5 - Entity Relationship Diagrams and the SE Life Cycle 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The text for this course focuses on steps 1 - 3 above 

related data - databases stores info about one enterprise, organization,
	busines, group of related people or processes

	* it's not appropriate to keep unrelated entities in the same 
	database, just keep a database about each separately

Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram - blueprint from which actual data 
	are stored, output of the design phase 

Users vs. Analysts:
* users are typically successful at a business, they understand the 
  business model

* user descriptions may be vague and unstructured 

* analysts may be ignorant of the business but understands the computer end 
  of the problem 

Review of Early Steps in SE Life Cycle Applied to Database Design:

Phase 1: Get Requirements for the Database
	* listen/ask questions about what data the user wants to organize
	into a database retrieval system 

Phase 2: Specify the Database 
	* descriptions and diagrams of what analyst thinks user wants 
	* usually accomplished with an ER diagram as blueprint for 
	  to-be-designed database 

Phase 3: Design the Database 
	* once finalized, ER diagram become blueprint for construction
	  of the database
